Project name: Cura +

Description: Cura + is a  user-friendly and completely free “Self Symptom Checking” tool which is based on a certified artificial intelligence technology that use proven medical knowledge.
The core technology has been developed by qualified doctors to bring anyone a safe and effective way to evaluate their health problems.
Cura+ is designed to help users understand what their medical symptoms might mean, and provide them with trusted information about their conditions using a medically validated system.

The patient can easily enter age, gender and multiple symptoms (aided by interactive body images).
The combination of symptoms is analysed by the artificial intelligence (AI) engine and possible diagnoses are linked to further knowledge, so the patient can research their symptoms.
